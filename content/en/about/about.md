I started a company some years ago intending to act as a conduit between tree entities that work together in a symbiosis relation.
In my opinion, these three entities are

* the public
* the business/professionals
* the regulator/government.

I have had prior exposure and training with my first job in New Zealand. It is here that I saw this gap that I wanted to address. When I joined Radio Spectrum Management, I quickly realized how deep the rabbit hole goes and that I have only scratched the surface.

Thus Spectrum Efficiency was incorporated:

Due to conflict of interests, I never pursued the dream of owning a company. I kept the name and it stands for:

> How efficient are you in delivering a specific communication given that you only have a certain amount of time to do it.

The values that it is built on are 

### Professionalism 

* I want to share thoughts and have opinions about various topics within the telecommunications industry.

### Accuracy 

* I want to always base my opinions on facts and provide a reproducible report. 

### Optimized

* I want to provide the easiest most efficient way to consume this information. 
Our Motivation
A gap exists between the Data Scientist's skillset and the Business Objectives.


Organizations are investing heavily into Data Science hiring because they know that Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science are the future. However, this investment takes time to pay off because Data Scientists need to learn the business and understand which problems are important to focus on. This is the gap.

Business Science has developed methodologies, tools, and techniques to overcome the gap through our consulting program. Now, Business Science has opened these tools up to the public as a way to accelerate the growth of these powerful Data Scientists. It's this Data Scientist empowerment that motivates us.

Our Values
Customer
Never stop until the customer is 100% satisfied

Collaboration
Work as a team to accomplish exponentially more than the sum of the parts

Creativity
Be adventurous, unafraid of challenges, constantly learning and ready to innovate

Community
Give back in the form of tools that progress the data science community
