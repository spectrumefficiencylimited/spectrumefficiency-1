I like building data process. A lot. And, unlike my stakeholders, I consider change, just the necessary step, that when implemented together, it makes a significant impact in their work life. Luckily for my stakeholders, I like resolving the business challenges even more.

I also quite like data visualization â€“ charts and dashboards like sharable data interactions using the Shiny framework. Yes, I like looking at youtube videos of other people building data dashboards in my spare time.

I amounted to more than ten+ years of experience in the telecommunication industry, and the last three years have been within the government.

When not eagerly anticipating my next innovation challenge, I will be doing something daunting like diving, mountain biking, snowboarding, or else running or at the gym.
