I started a company some years ago intending to act as a conduit between tree entities that work together in a symbiosis relation.
In my opinion, these three entities are

* the public
* the business/professionals
* the regulator/government.

I have had prior exposure and training with my first job in New Zealand. It is here that I saw this gap that I wanted to address. When I joined Radio Spectrum Management, I quickly realized how deep the rabbit hole goes and that I have only scratched the surface.

Thus Spectrum Efficiency was incorporated:

Due to conflict of interests, I never pursued the dream of owning a company. I kept the name and it stands for:

> How efficient are you in delivering a specific communication given that you only have a certain amount of time to do it.

The values that it is built on are 

### Professionalism 

* I want to share thoughts and have opinions about various topics within the telecommunications industry.

### Accuracy 

* I want to always base my opinions on facts and provide a reproducible report. 

### Optimized

* I want to provide the easiest most efficient way to consume this information.
